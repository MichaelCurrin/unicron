No Python packages needed. Just clone, configure and run. 🐍 🎉 🦄

Easy scheduler to run tasks exactly once per day and retry at intervals if a task fails. This avoids waste from running too often and is also more flexible than a plain cron task which only runs once every 24 hours (which might fail or be missed). It can watch as many tasks as you want.

<!-- Note Docsify does not support :unicorn: so use unicode above instead. -->
