### Install Crontab

This is installed usually on a fresh macOS or Linux setup.

Otherwise, follow instructions below to install.

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
$ sudo apt install python3-crontab
```


## Clone the repo

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:MichaelCurrin/unicron.git
$ cd unicron
```


## Install project packages

There are _no_ Python packages needed to run the main application.

But if you want to install and use the dev dependencies for local development, see the [Development](development.md) page.

If this is your first time using Unicron, you can skip ahead to the [Usage](usage.md) doc to see how to run Unicron.


## Set up Unicron as a scheduled task

Continue to the [Set up cron](setup_cron.md) page to setup Unicron as scheduled item which manages your configured tasks.
